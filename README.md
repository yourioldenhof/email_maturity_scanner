# Happy Horizon E-mail Maturity Scanner
Happy Horizon, a creative digital agency based in Eindhoven, was looking for new ways to quickly bind customers. An idea for this is an application that can scan the different digital marketing disciplines of a company. Based on predefined questions, the application provides insight into the maturity of the (potential) new customer. How mature is your E-mail marketing set up, and where are there still opportunities? With this application you will find out in a few clicks.

Through the realization of an application that tries to generate leads, this assignment aims to provide a new lead generator tool for Happy Horizon.

# How to use
To use the E-mail Maturity Scan, you only need to load the files into a local server (XAMP, MAMP). A local database is desirable, but not necessary to experience the concept. 
Once the local server is started, open the index.php. From there, use the buttons to navigate through the E-mail Maturity Scanner. 
By default, the E-mail Maturity Scanner is not linked to a database. As a result, the values accompanying the answers that can be given do not influence the result obtained. Want to make this work completely? Then use a local database where the math can be done to show the correct result.
